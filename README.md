# RealActivity’s AI Playbook for Mission-Critical Healthcare

##### *Guidance, Tools, and Resources for Technical Executives and Developers*

## Welcome to RealActivity’s AI Playbook for Mission-Critical Healthcare

This repo is your launchpad for designing **mission-critical Copilots and agentic workflows** that can thrive inside the regulatory, security, and reliability demands of modern healthcare systems. Curated by RealActivity’s engineering team, these resources give technical leaders—CIOs, chief architects, staff engineers, and DevOps pros—the patterns, reference code, and governance checklists required to turn generative AI from proof-of-concept into production-grade clinical and operational solutions.

* **Enterprise-First Lens.** Every sample, white-paper, and script is stress-tested against the realities of HIPAA, CMS compliance, and hospital-scale infrastructure.  
* **Demystify Agentic AI.** Deep-dive articles (see the Substack link) break down planning, tool-calling, RAG, and multi-agent orchestration without the buzzword fog.  
* **Build & Benchmark.** Hands-on labs show how to wire up Semantic Kernel, Azure AI Agent Service, and SQL-backed memory so your Copilot can handle real-world load and latency targets.  

> **Pro Tip:** Aim your favorite LLM at this repo—let it ingest the patterns, then come to the workshop ready to debate architecture choices with data in hand.
