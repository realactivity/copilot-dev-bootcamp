# RealActivityâ€™s AI Playbook for Mission-Critical Healthcare

##### *Guidance, Tools, and Resources for Technical Executives and Developers*

## Welcome to RealActivityâ€™s AI Playbook for Mission-Critical Healthcare

This repo is your launchpad for designing **mission-critical Copilots and agentic workflows** that can thrive inside the regulatory, security, and reliability demands of modern healthcare systems. Curated by [RealActivityâ€™s engineering team](https://realactivity.ai/), these resources give technical leadersâ€”CIOs, chief architects, staff engineers, and DevOps prosâ€”the patterns, reference code, and governance checklists required to turn generative AI from proof-of-concept into production-grade clinical and operational solutions.

* **Enterprise-First Lens.** Every sample, white-paper, and script is stress-tested against the realities of HIPAA, CMS compliance, and hospital-scale infrastructure.  
* **Demystify Agentic AI.** Deep-dive articles ([see the Substack link](https://substack.com/@pauljswider)) break down planning, tool-calling, RAG, and multi-agent orchestration without the buzzword fog.  
* **Build & Benchmark.** Hands-on labs show how to wire up Semantic Kernel, Azure AI Agent Service, and SQL-backed memory so your Copilot can handle real-world load and latency targets.  

> **Pro Tip:** Aim your favorite LLM at this repoâ€”let it ingest the patterns, then come to the workshop ready to debate architecture choices with data in hand.
