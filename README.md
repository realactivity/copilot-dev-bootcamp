The workshop, led by Paul Swider, is designed to navigate C-suite executives, board directors, and staff through the intricate process of preparing and deploying generative AI technologies. It provides a checklist that acts as a strategic guide through this technological journey, alongside a live demo of Copilot, showcasing tangible AI capabilities. The repository includes a detailed agenda for the Southeast Asia Autumn 2023 workshop, covering locations like Manila, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore, and also provides downloadable PowerPoint slides. Additional resources and links for both executive and technical audiences are provided, ensuring a well-rounded understanding and application of the knowledge shared.
