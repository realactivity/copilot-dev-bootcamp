# From Code to Intelligence – Building NextGen AI Agents

As a hands-on enterprise developer, I’ll take you on a fast, code-first tour of what separates real agents from garden-variety functions. We’ll crack open the architecture that lets them reason, measure that intelligence with hard metrics, then wire up semantic-aware functions that pick the right tools and recover gracefully when things get weird. We’ll bolt on true memory, short-term context for snappy conversations and long-term state for constant self-improvement, and inject Microsoft’s latest research, from AutoGen’s swarming agents to Magnetic-One’s rock-solid enterprise patterns. By the end, you’ll have a blueprint you can push straight into Azure and the confidence to future-proof whatever you build next.
