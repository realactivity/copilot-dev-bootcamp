## Sessions & How They Unite Under the Theme

Each session in the agenda addresses a different facet of our unifying story. Together, they form a complete picture of **innovation easing the burdens** in healthcare:

- **Unlocking Healthcare Innovation with Microsoft Fabric** – *Speakers: Mike Grondahl & Corey Soule.* This session shows how a unified analytics platform can **eliminate data silos** and compliance headaches. Microsoft Fabric’s all-in-one data environment (with built-in governance via Purview) frees up organizations from piecemeal tools, reducing the *burden of managing complex data pipelines*. The result? Healthcare teams spend less time wrestling data and more time innovating with insights.
- **A Deep Dive into Microsoft’s Health Ecosystem** – *Speaker: Paul Swider.* An exploration of Microsoft’s integrated healthcare offerings demonstrates **the power of a connected ecosystem**. From Azure Health Data Services and FHIR to AI tools like Azure Health Bot and OpenAI services, this talk ties together how **cloud and AI** can streamline patient information flow and personalize care. It reinforces the event’s mission by showing that when tools talk to each other, caregivers are **less burdened by fragmentation** and can deliver smarter, more coordinated care.
- **Off-Limits Data: Training AI in a World of Contracts, Clauses, and Compliance** – *Speakers: James Griffin & Alex Tuck.* Innovation can stall under the weight of regulatory and contractual constraints. This talk addresses a very modern burden: **figuring out what data your AI can legally and ethically learn from**. James and Alex provide a playbook for navigating “no AI training” clauses and strict privacy rules without halting progress. By establishing clear internal policies and governance (the kind Microsoft Purview or similar tools can help with), organizations can **stay compliant** *and* innovative. In the bigger story, this session ensures that fear of compliance pitfalls doesn’t become a burden that **derails AI advancements** – it shows how to keep moving forward responsibly.
- **Spurring Technical Innovation via Open Source** – *Speaker: Rachel Roumeliotis.* How can healthcare leap forward without re-inventing the wheel each time? Rachel answers that through **open source collaboration**. In this session, attendees see that innovation accelerates when we share solutions and invite diverse contributors. By embracing open-source tools and communities, healthcare IT teams can solve problems faster and cheaper, rather than feeling isolated with proprietary burdens. This theme of openness complements Microsoft’s own open ecosystem strategy and reinforces the event’s story: *working together* (and even **outside** your organization’s walls) is a key to **overcoming technical burdens** and sparking new ideas in healthcare.
- **Preparing Your Healthcare Organization for AI and the Agentic Future** – *Speaker: Pablo Gazmuri.* As AI evolves from simple assistance to autonomous “agents,” healthcare organizations must be ready. Pablo’s talk delves into how to **prepare infrastructure and culture today** so that tomorrow’s AI can be deployed safely and effectively. Covering everything from data readiness and network modernization to change management, this session ties into the overarching narrative by addressing the fear of the unknown. It assures leaders that with the right preparation, the next wave of AI (think autonomous documentation or automated patient flow management) won’t be a burden but a boon. This forward-looking strategy keeps the **mission grounded**: plan smartly now to avoid being overwhelmed later.
- **Healthcare AI Agents: The Next Frontier of Intelligent, Scalable Healthcare** – *Speaker: Alex Lee.* Providing a visionary complement to Pablo’s preparation talk, Alex paints a picture of AI agents in action – from ambient AI scribes that **free clinicians from note-taking** to virtual care agents guiding patients. It’s an exciting glimpse into how routine tasks might soon be offloaded to intelligent systems, **lifting burdens** off human shoulders. By showcasing tangible examples of AI agents improving scalability and care quality, this session reinforces the unifying story: that embracing such innovations can **dramatically reduce workload and burnout** in healthcare. It leaves the audience inspired about what’s coming, while still grounded in real prototypes and pilots happening now (not sci-fi).
- **Seamless Integration: Azure Health Data Service as the Virtual Hub for FHIR Data** – *Speakers: Andy Vadula & Hector Pacheco.* Interoperability – the challenge of getting different systems to share and understand data – is a classic burden in healthcare IT. In this talk, two experts from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center demonstrate a solution: using Azure Health Data Services as a **central FHIR data hub**. They show how an intelligent FHIR proxy can route data between systems seamlessly, so clinicians and researchers get a complete view without jumping through hoops. This session ties into our mission by attacking the frustration of disconnected systems: with the right architecture, **data flows where it needs to, when it needs to**, reducing delays, errors, and duplication. It’s a real-world example of Microsoft cloud tools cutting through complexity to make everyone’s job easier in a healthcare setting.
- **Choosing the Right Storage Solution for Your Projects** – *Speaker: Jamel Abed.* Every innovation rests on a solid foundation. Jamel’s session, while broadly applicable beyond healthcare, addresses a fundamental question for any IT project: where and how to store your data. By providing a clear checklist and comparing options (from SharePoint to Azure cloud storage), this talk helps attendees avoid the **costly burden of poor storage decisions**. In context of our theme, it underscores that intelligent innovation isn’t only about flashy AI – it’s also about **getting the basics right** to save time, money, and headaches down the line. Plus, with insights on how tools like Microsoft 365 and Copilot can automate data management, it connects back to the idea of leveraging AI even in our infrastructure. In short, this session keeps our mission grounded: start with strong, efficient foundations to support all the higher-level innovations in healthcare.

## Unifying Message – **Innovation with Purpose**
