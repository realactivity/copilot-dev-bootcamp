# From Code to Intelligence â€“ Building NextGen AI Agents

This developer-focused session builds on last year's "Introduction to Semantic Kernel" presentation, taking you deeper into the world of intelligent, adaptive AI agents. Learn how to transform basic functions into semantically-aware systems that can reason, remember, and evolve through interactions.

## What You'll Learn

### Understanding Agentic AI Architecture

This session breaks down the fundamental architecture behind truly intelligent AI agents. You'll learn:

- The distinction between traditional AI functions and agentic systems
- Core components of adaptive AI architectures
- Implementation patterns for building agents that can reason and adapt
- Evaluation frameworks for measuring agent intelligence

### Orchestrating AI with Semantic-Aware Functions

Move beyond static function calls to dynamic, context-driven orchestration:

- Techniques for creating functions that understand semantic context
- Methods for optimizing workflows through intelligent function selection
- Implementation strategies for self-improving function orchestration
- Patterns for handling edge cases and unexpected inputs

### Managing Semantic App State

Discover how to build AI systems with memory and evolutionary capabilities:

- Approaches for maintaining conversational and operational context
- Techniques for knowledge persistence across interactions
- Implementation of real-time adaptation based on user feedback
- Methods for balancing short-term reactivity with long-term learning

### Applying Microsoft Research Insights

Learn how to leverage cutting-edge research in your applications:

- Practical applications of AutoGen framework for agent collaboration
- Implementation techniques from Magnetic-One for enterprise scenarios
- Integration patterns for current Microsoft AI services
- Future-proofing strategies based on research directions
