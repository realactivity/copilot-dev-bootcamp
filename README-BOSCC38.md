# From Code to Intelligence in Global Health

##### *Building Next-Gen AI Agents for Clinical Informatics - Resources for Technical Executives and Developers*

Modern enterprises don‚Äôt just need *code*‚Äîthey need **intelligent, adaptive agents** that reason, remember, and operate safely at scale. In this fast-paced three-hour workshop you‚Äôll move beyond ‚Äúhello-world‚Äù prompts and discover how Microsoft‚Äôs open-source toolchain (Semantic Kernel, Azure AI Agent Service, AutoGen, and friends) turns ordinary functions into enterprise-grade AI agents.

We‚Äôll start by demystifying agentic concepts and design patterns, then dive into **hands-on labs** where you‚Äôll build and orchestrate agents in both Python *and* C#. You‚Äôll scaffold a simple assistant, add tool-calling and planning, infuse memory with RAG, and finish with a multi-agent scenario‚Äîall on your own laptop. Along the way we‚Äôll highlight responsible-AI guardrails and production-ready deployment tips drawn from Microsoft Research projects such as Magnetic-One.

Whether you‚Äôre upgrading an existing Copilot or green-fielding a brand-new solution, you‚Äôll leave with runnable code, reference repos, and a clear mental model for taking agentic AI from proof-of-concept to production. A good vibe, a little humor, and rock-solid engineering discipline included.
